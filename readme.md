# Weather Prediction Project

This repository contains a project aimed at analyzing and predicting weather patterns using machine learning. The core functionality is implemented in a Jupyter notebook, and weather data is provided in a CSV file.

## Contents

- **`predict.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the weather prediction model.
- **`weather.csv`**: A dataset with historical weather data, used for training and evaluating the model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following installed:

- Python (>= 3.7)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Necessary Python packages (listed below)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-prediction.git
   cd weather-prediction
2. Install the required packages:
    ``bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
3. Launch the Jupyter notebook:
    ``bash
    jupyter notebook predict.ipynb

### Dataset
The file weather.csv contains historical weather data. Ensure the dataset is in the same directory as the notebook or update the file path in the notebook accordingly.

### Usage
Open the predict.ipynb notebook in Jupyter.
Run the cells sequentially to:
Load and preprocess the dataset.
Train a weather prediction model.
Evaluate the model's performance.
Visualize predictions and insights.
### Features
Data preprocessing and visualization.
Training a machine learning model for weather prediction.
Performance evaluation metrics and visualizations.
